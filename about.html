  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am an astronomer working on the formation and evolution of planetary
    systems. My research focuses on the physical processes operating in
    protoplanetary disks, particularly during the late stages when gas is
    dispersed and planetary architectures are finalized.
  </p>

  <p>
    I use a combination of observational data, theoretical modeling, and
    numerical simulations to study disk winds, gas chemistry, and the
    interaction between forming planets and their natal environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    My broader interests include disk evolution, star–planet interactions,
    and the connection between disk properties and exoplanet populations.
